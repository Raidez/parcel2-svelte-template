# Parcel 2 + Svelte starter kit

If you're looking to get started using the Parcel 2 bundler and Svelte, then this is the place for you.

## Getting started

It couldn't be easier to get started. Simply fork or clone the repo into a local folder and run the `npm` install command:

```
npm install
```

This will install the following dependencies:

-   Parcel JS bundler
-   Svelte

## Running the starter kit

If you checkout the `package.json` file, you'll see two scripts, one for development and one for building a production bundle.

To start the development server, you'll want this command:

```
npm run start
```

This will quickly bundle all of the necessary files and kick off the development server, which is generated at `http://localhost:1234`.
